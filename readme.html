        <h1>Explination</h1>
        <P>PART 1: "dont judge a book by its cover"</p>
        <p>The entire page appears to be black.</p> 
        <p>A quick glance and one might find it pointless, maybe even an error.</p>
        <p>It is not unitl one interacts with the page that any nuance is noticeable.</p>
        <p>PART 2: From dark to light.</p>
        <p>Considering this was created in the peak of winter 2020,</p>
        <p>this work mimics the transition from the dark and dull mood of the winter, to the bright mood</p>
        <p>of spring & summer, as well as hope for the post-Covid world.</p>
        <p>PART 3: Regression to the mean.</p>
        <p>Finally, this work shows that the transition to light is not final.</p>
        <p>Fall/Winter always comes after spring/summer, spring/summer always follows Fall/Winter, and Covid won't disappear forever.</p>
